# Breast Cancer Classification with Logistic Regression and K-Fold Cross-Validation
This folder contains Python code for performing breast cancer classification using Logistic Regression and K-Fold Cross-Validation. It uses the popular breast cancer dataset and demonstrates how to split the data into training and testing sets, train a Logistic Regression model, and evaluate its performance using K-Fold Cross-Validation.

## Overview

Breast cancer classification is a common machine learning task where the goal is to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant based on various features. Logistic Regression is a simple yet effective algorithm for binary classification, and K-Fold Cross-Validation is used to assess its performance robustly.

## Code Structure

    Breast_Cancer_Logistic_Regression_KFold.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code.
    README.md: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    Jupyter Notebook
    Scikit-Learn

## Results

The code provides the following results:

    Accuracy scores for each fold of K-Fold Cross-Validation.
    Mean accuracy score across all folds.

These results help assess the performance of the Logistic Regression model on the breast cancer dataset.
