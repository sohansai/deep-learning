# Breast Cancer Classification with Hyperparameter Tuning

This folder contains code for a breast cancer classification task using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) with and without hyperparameter tuning.

## Dataset

We use the built-in breast cancer dataset from Scikit-Learn, which includes various features related to breast cancer tumors.

# Overview

In this project, we perform the following steps:

1. Import necessary libraries and load the Breast Cancer dataset.
2. Extract features and target variables.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Train a Support Vector Classifier without hyperparameter tuning and evaluate its performance.
5. Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for the SVC model.
6. Train a Support Vector Classifier with the tuned hyperparameters and evaluate its performance.
7. Visualize and compare the results.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib (for potential visualizations)

## Acknowledgments

- The Breast Cancer dataset used in this project is part of Scikit-Learn's built-in datasets.
