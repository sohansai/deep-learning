# MNIST Optimizer Comparison

This repository contains a TensorFlow project that compares the performance of different optimizers on the MNIST dataset. The implemented code trains models using Adam, SGD, and RMSprop optimizers, measuring accuracy and training time. The validation accuracy over epochs is visualized for each optimizer.

## Overview

The project consists of the following files:

- `mnist_optimizer_comparison.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code.
- `mnist_optimization_project/`: Folder containing related files.

## Instructions

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `mnist_optimizer_comparison.ipynb`.

## Dependencies

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Results

The project generates a comparison of validation accuracy over epochs for Adam, SGD, and RMSprop optimizers. The results are insightful for understanding the impact of different optimizers on model performance.
